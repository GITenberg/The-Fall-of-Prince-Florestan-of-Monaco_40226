<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>THE FALL
OF PRINCE FLORESTAN OF MONACO.</h2>
<p>I am Prince Florestan of Wurtemberg, born in 1850, and
consequently now of the mature age of twenty-four. I might call
myself &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Florestan</span> II.&rdquo; but
I think it better taste for a dethroned prince, especially when
he happens to be a republican, to resume the name that is in
reality his own.</p>
<p>Although the events which I am about to relate occurred this
winter, so little is known in England of the affairs of the
Ex-principality of <a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>Monaco, now forming the French commune of that name, that
I feel that the details of my story, indeed all but the bare
facts on which it is grounded, will be news to English
readers.&nbsp; The English Post Office believes that Monaco forms
part of Italy, and the general election extinguished the
telegrams that arrived from France in February last.</p>
<p>All who follow continental politics are aware that the Prince
Charles Honor&eacute;, known as Charles III. of Monaco, and also
called on account of his infirmity &ldquo;the blind
prince,&rdquo; was the ruling potentate of Monaco during the last
gambling season; that there lived with him his mother, the
dowager princess; that he was a widower with one son, Prince
Albert, Duc de Valentinois, heir apparent to the throne; that the
latter had by his marriage with the Princess Marie of Hamilton,
sister to the Duke of Hamilton, one <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>son who in 1873 was six years old;
that all the family lived on M. Blanc the lessee of the gambling
tables.&nbsp; But Monaco is shut off from the rest of the world
except in the winter months, and few have heard of the calamities
which since the end of January have rained upon the ruling
family.&nbsp; My cousin, Prince Albert, the &ldquo;Sailor
Prince,&rdquo; a good fellow of my own age, with no fault but his
rash love of uselessly braving the perils of the ocean, had often
been warned of the fate that would one day befall him.&nbsp; Once
when a boy he had put to sea in his boat when a fearful storm was
raging, had been upset just off the point at Monaco, and had been
saved only by the gallantry of a sailor of the port who had
risked his own life in keeping his sovereign&rsquo;s son
afloat.&nbsp; In October 1873 my unfortunate cousin bought at
Plymouth an <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>English sailing yacht of 450 tons.&nbsp; He had a
sailor&rsquo;s contempt for steam, which he told me was only fit
for lubbers, when he came up and stayed with me at Cambridge in
November to see the &ldquo;fours.&rdquo;&nbsp; He explained to me
then that he had got a bargain, that he had bought his yacht for
one-third her value, and that he was picking up a capital crew of
thirty men.&nbsp; He had no need to buy yachts for a third their
value, for he was rich enough and to spare, having enjoyed the
large fortune of his mother from the time he came of age.&nbsp;
She was a M&eacute;rode, and vast forests in Belgium&mdash;part
of Soignies for instance&mdash;belonged to him.&nbsp; His wife
had her own fortune of four and a half million francs, bringing
her in about seven thousand pounds a year, so he was able to
spend all his money on himself.&nbsp; He did not spend it on his
dress, for when he came to Cambridge and was introduced <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>to Dr.
Thompson, he neither had a dress suit to dine in at the lodge,
nor a black morning coat to put on for hall, where his rough
pea-jacket scandalised the &ldquo;scouts.&rdquo;&nbsp; He sailed
from Plymouth in November, and reached Monaco at the end of that
month.&nbsp; In December he made several excursions, in none of
which did his father go to sea with him, but on the 26th of
January, as ill luck would have it, he tempted my poor uncle to
go with him for a three days&rsquo; cruise.&nbsp; It came on to
blow hard that night, and nothing was ever heard of them
again.&nbsp; Great was the excitement at Monaco on the 27th and
28th, but on the 29th the worst was known, as a telegram from
Genoa informed the unfortunate old princess&mdash;who has all her
faculties at the age of eighty-six&mdash;that her son and
grandson were both numbered with the dead, for one of the boats
of the rotten yacht had been fallen <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>in with by a fishing vessel floating
empty in mid sea.</p>
<p>The Conseil d&rsquo;Etat was at once called together by the
Governor General, and the little boy of the Princess Marie
proclaimed by their order at the market-place.&nbsp; A
proclamation was posted in the town the moment the sitting ended,
declaring the joint regency of the dowager princess and of Baron
Imberty.&nbsp; A telegram was sent to Princess Marie, who was
staying with her child at Nice, informing her of her
husband&rsquo;s death and of the accession of her son, and
begging that she would the next day confide the little Duc de
Valentinois to the deputation of the councillors of state and of
the officers of guards, who would reach Nice by train at
noon.&nbsp; She was in the same despatch assured that on the
death of the old dowager princess she should succeed her in the
regency, <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>but
for family reasons on which I need not enlarge, she was requested
not on this occasion to accompany her son.</p>
<p>All this I learnt by a telegram from the baron; I, as the son
of the sister of the late prince, having now become most
unexpectedly next heir to the throne of Monaco.&nbsp; I had no
idea of the possibility of my ever being called upon to succeed a
healthy boy of six, and gave the matter no thought but one of
regret at the death of my gallant cousin Albert, who in the
Prussian war had proved his courage in the French navy, while I,
had I been older, should have had to have fought upon the other
side, my father having been a prince of Wurtemberg.</p>
<p>I was thoroughly English in my ways.&nbsp; My father, a man of
wide and liberal views, disliking &ldquo;professors&rdquo; as
much as Mr. Disraeli does, and especially distrusting Prussian <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>pedagogues, had
sent me to Eton and to Trinity. At Eton I had lived rather with
the King&rsquo;s scholars than with my more natural allies, and
had imbibed some views at which my poor father would have
groaned.&nbsp; When I went up to Cambridge my friendships were in
King&rsquo;s rather than in Third Trinity, and my opinions were
those now popular among spectacled undergraduates, namely,
universal negation.&nbsp; I even joined First Trinity Boat Club,
instead of Third, because the gentlemen of the latter were too
exclusive for my princely tastes.</p>
<p>During my four years at Cambridge I had rowed in First Trinity
Second.&nbsp; I had heard at the Union Mr. Seeley defend the
Commune, and oppose a motion declaring it innocent because it did
not go on to express the &ldquo;love and affection&rdquo; with
which that body was regarded by the University.&nbsp; I had
supported a young <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>fellow of Trinity when he showed that the surplus funds
of the Union Society should be applied to the erection of statues
of Mazzini in all the small villages of the West of
England&mdash;a motion which I believe was carried, but
neutralized by the fact that the Union Society possessed no
surplus funds.&nbsp; I had also had the inestimable advantage of
attending the lectures of Professor Fawcett on the English poor
laws.&nbsp; I had, by the way, almost forgotten the most amusing
of all the Union episodes of my time, which was the rising of Mr.
Dilke of Trinity Hall, Sir Charles Dilke&rsquo;s
brother&mdash;but a man of more real talent than his brother,
although, if possible, a still more lugubrious speaker&mdash;to
move that his brother&rsquo;s portrait, together with that of
Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice, the communist brother of a Marquis and a
congenial spirit, should be suspended in the committee <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>room to watch
over the deliberations of that body, because, forsooth, they had
happened to be president and vice-president of the Society at a
moment when the new buildings were begun out of the subscriptions
of such very different politicians as the Prince of Wales, the
Duke of Devonshire, and Lord Powis.&nbsp; Mr. Dilke and his
radicals were sometimes in a majority and sometimes in a minority
at the Union, and the portraits of the republican lord and
baronet went up on the wall or down under the table accordingly,
Mr. Willimott, the valued custodian of the rooms, carrying out
the orders of both sides with absolute impartiality.</p>
<p>Fired with the enthusiasm of my party and of my age, I had
subscribed to the Woman&rsquo;s Suffrage Association, to Mr.
Bradlaugh&rsquo;s election expenses, to the Anti-Game-Law
Association, and to the Education League.&nbsp; My reading was
less <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>one-sided than my politics, and my republicanism was
tempered by an unwavering worship of &ldquo;Lothair.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mr. Disraeli was my admiration as a public man&mdash;a Bismarck
without his physique and his opportunities&mdash;but then in
politics one always personally prefers one&rsquo;s opponents to
one&rsquo;s friends.&nbsp; As a republican, I had a cordial
aversion for Sir Charles Dilke, a clever writer, but an awfully
dull speaker, who imagines that his forte is public speaking, and
who, having been brought up in a set of strong prejudices,
positively makes a merit to himself of never having got over
them.&nbsp; This he calls &ldquo;never changing his
opinions.&rdquo;&nbsp; For Mr. Gladstone I had the ordinary
undergraduate detestation.&nbsp; There are no liberals at
Cambridge.&nbsp; We were all rank republicans or champions of
right divine.</p>
<p>The 31st of January was a strange day in my history.&nbsp; On
entering my rooms in my <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>flannels, hot from the boats, and
hurrying for hall, I saw a telegram upon the table.&nbsp; I tore
it open.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<i>The
Governor-General</i>, <i>Monaco</i>;<br />
<i>to</i><br />
<i>His Serene Highness Prince Florestan</i>,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Trinity College</i>,<br />
<i>Cambridge</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;His Serene Highness!&rdquo;&nbsp; Surely a
mistake!&nbsp; I read on.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This morning at noon his Serene Highness
the reigning prince was committed by the princess his mother to
the care of M. Henri de Payan, at Nice.&nbsp; The princess being
nervous about railway accidents, the departure for Monaco took
place by road.&nbsp; The carriage conveying his Serene Highness
and M. de Payan was drawn by four horses.&nbsp; Turbie was
reached without mishap, but <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>half-way between Turbie and
Roquebrune, at a sharp turn in the road, the horses took fright,
and the coachman, in avoiding the precipice, threw the carriage
upon the rocks on the mountain side of the road.&nbsp; His Serene
Highness was thrown on his head and killed on the spot.&nbsp;
Your Serene Highness is now reigning prince of Monaco, and will
be proclaimed to-night after the meeting of the Council of State
by the style of Florestan II.&nbsp; Lieutenant Gasignol, of the
guard, will proceed at once to England and meet your Serene
Highness at any spot which your Highness may please to
indicate.&nbsp; M. de Payan escaped without a scratch.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prince of Monaco!&nbsp; Prince of Monaco.&nbsp; And I had seen
Lafont in <i>Rabagas</i>!&nbsp; I was not a &ldquo;milk-and-water
Rabagas,&rdquo; as Mr. Cole called Mr. Lowe, when all the papers
reported him to have said &ldquo;milk-and-water Rabelais,&rdquo;
and the <i>Spectator</i> <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>mildly wondered at the strangeness of
the comparison.&nbsp; No, but I was somewhat of a milk-and-water
Prince of Monaco after Lafont.&nbsp; What distinction!&nbsp; What
carriage!&nbsp; If the princes of the earth were only like the
princes of the stage, there would be no republicans.&nbsp; But
then, fortunately, they are not.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fortunately!&rdquo;
and I one of them.&nbsp; What am I saying?</p>
<p>Poor little fellow!&nbsp; How sad for his young mother
too.&nbsp; A reigning prince for nineteen hours, and that outside
of his own dominions and at the age of six.&nbsp; A strange
world! and a strange world, for me too.&nbsp; A half-Protestant,
half-free-thinking, republican, German, Cambridge undergraduate,
suddenly called to rule despotically over a Catholic and Italian
people.&nbsp; My succession, at least, would be undisputed.&nbsp;
No one had ever vowed that I &ldquo;should never ascend the
throne&mdash;without a protest.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of the <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>Grimaldis had
a claim which was no doubt a just one, my respected great uncle
having been probably a usurper; but Marshal MacMahon and the Duc
de Broglie would, I well knew, support me, preferring even a
German prince at Monaco to an Italian.&nbsp; My succession, I
repeat, was undisputed; but if anybody had taken the trouble to
dispute it, I can answer for it that they would have been cheated
out of their amusement, for I should willingly have resigned to
their charge so burdensome a toy.&nbsp; I was that which the
republican mayor of Birmingham, Mr. Joseph Chamberlain, in his
jocular speech proposing the Prince of Wales&rsquo; health at the
mayor&rsquo;s banquet, said that one of his friends had been
trying by argument to make the Prince&mdash;with, &ldquo;as
yet,&rdquo; only &ldquo;partial success&rdquo;&mdash;a republican
King.&nbsp; I would have gone only to Monaco to proclaim the
republic had I not known that <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>the strange despotism&mdash;presided
over not as a despotism should be by one clever despot, but by
two stupid despots, the Dukes of Magenta and Broglie&mdash;which
is called the French republic, would not permit the creation of a
small model for herself in the middle of her commune of
Roquebrune.</p>
<p>I was not sorry to leave Cambridge.&nbsp; My rooms in the new
court overlooked Caius, where they had typhoid fever; and between
the fear of infection and the noise of the freshmen&rsquo;s wines
in Trinity Hall, I was beginning to have enough of
Cambridge.&nbsp; My bedmaker and tutor were the only people to
whom I bid goodbye.&nbsp; The men were all in hall and out at
wines, and I left notes for my friends instead of looking them up
in their rooms.&nbsp; I caught my tutor as he was going into
hall.&nbsp; I told him of the news, and I could see the idea of
an invitation for <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>next winter to the castle at Monaco pass through his
mind as he assured me that my rule would be a blessing to my
country, and that nothing could better fit me for a sceptre than
the training of an English gentleman.&nbsp; He added, with a
return of the grim humour of a don, that he supposed that as a
sovereign prince I need scarcely &ldquo;take an
<i>exeat</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; My poor old bed-maker, who had read
the telegram in my absence from my room, called me &ldquo;your
imperial majesty&rdquo; three times while she packed my shirts,
but in half-an-hour I was off to London; and on the evening of
the 3rd of February I met M. de Payan and Lieutenant Gasignol by
appointment at the Grand Hotel at Paris.</p>
<p>From M. de Payan I obtained my first accurate ideas as to the
State of Monaco.&nbsp; I found that I was not more independent
under the supremacy of France than is the Emperor William <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>independent
under the domination of Prince von Bismarck.&nbsp; I had not only
the Code Napol&eacute;on, and a Council of State dressed in exact
copies of their Versailles namesakes, but French custom-house
officers levying French custom-house duties in my
dominions.&nbsp; At the beginning of our conversation I had said
to M. de Payan, &ldquo;Between ourselves, and fearing though I do
that like Charles I. of England I may be committing high treason
against myself, I feel bound to tell you that my only ideas of my
principality are derived from M. Sardou&rsquo;s
<i>Rabagas</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why is it that inhabitants of small and isolated communities
never can see a joke?&nbsp; M. de Payan, slightly drawing himself
up and speaking with as much stiffness as he could assume towards
his prince, gravely answered me, &ldquo;Your Serene Highness is
not aware, I presume, that <i>Rabagas</i> was a satire directed
against France <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>in her decline, and not against your Highness&rsquo;s
principality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>M. Sardou wasting his hours on satirising Monaco.&nbsp; I will
never joke again, I said to myself, unless I should suffer the
modern fate of kings and be deposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;M. de Payan,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I am aware of
what you say, and I was joking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have no Gambettas at Monaco, your Highness; that is
all I meant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, Sir, the country would be happier if you
had.&nbsp; Rabagas was not Gambetta, but Emile Olivier&mdash;not
the man who never despaired of France, but the man who sacrificed
his opinions to his advancement.&nbsp; I admire M. Gambetta, who
is at this moment the first man in France, in my estimation, and
the second political man in Europe.&nbsp; His figure will stand
out in history, daubed as even it is with the mud that <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>French
politicians are ceaselessly flinging at each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;M. Gambetta is, as your Serene Highness says, a man of
extraordinary powers; but his father was a tradesman at Cahors,
and is retired and lives at Nice, near your Serene
Highness&rsquo;s dominions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What more could I say?&nbsp; There was nothing to be made of
M. de Payan.</p>
<p>On the 5th of February I reached Nice by the express, and
after reading the telegram which announced the return of Mr.
Gladstone by a discerning people as junior colleague to a gin
distiller, was presented with an address by the Gambettist mayor
at the desire of the legitimist pr&eacute;f&ecirc;t.&nbsp; The
mayor, being a red-hot republican in politics but a
carriage-builder by trade, lectured me on the drawbacks of
despotism in his address, but informed me in conversation <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>afterwards
that he had had the honour of building a Victoria for Prince
Charles Honor&eacute;&mdash;which was next door to giving me his
business card.&nbsp; The address, however, also assumed that the
Princes of Monaco were suffered only by Providence to exist in
order that the trade of Nice, the nearest large French town,
might thrive.</p>
<p>In the evening at four we reached the station at Monaco, which
was decked with the white flags of my ancestors.&nbsp; What a
pity, was my thought, that M. de Chambord should not be aware
that if he would come to stay with me at the castle he would live
under the white flag to which he is so much attached all the days
of his life.&nbsp; My reception was enthusiastic.&nbsp; The
guards, in blue uniforms not unlike the Bavarian, but with tall
shakoes instead of helmets, and similar to that which during the
stoppage of the train at Nice I had rapidly put on, were <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>drawn up in
line to the number of thirty-nine&mdash;one being in hospital
with a wart on his thumb, as M. de Payan told me.&nbsp; What an
admirable centralisation that such a detail should be known to
every member of the administration!&nbsp; Two drummers rolled
their drums French fashion.&nbsp; In front of the line were four
officers, of whom&mdash;one fat; Baron Imberty; the Vicar
General; and P&egrave;re Pellico of the Jesuits of the
Visitation, brother as I already knew to the celebrated Italian
patriot, Silvio Pellico, of dungeon and spider fame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is M. Blanc?&rdquo; I cried to M. de Payan, as we
stopped, seeing no one not in uniform or robes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;M. Blanc,&rdquo; said M. de Payan, severely,
&ldquo;though a useful subject of your Highness is neither a
member of the household of your Highness, a soldier of His army,
nor a <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>functionary of His government.&nbsp; M. Blanc is in the
crowd outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had I ventured to talk slang to M. de Payan, of whom I already
stood in awe, I should have replied, &ldquo;Elle est
<i>sal&eacute;e</i>, celle l&agrave;; puisque sans M. Blanc mon
pays ne marcherait pas.&rdquo;&nbsp; But I held my tongue.</p>
<p>I have seen many amusing sights in the course of my short
life.&nbsp; I have seen an Anglican clergyman dance the
cancan&mdash;I have seen Lord Claud Hamilton, the elder, address
the English House of Commons&mdash;I have watched with breathless
interest the gesticulations of French orators in the tribune of
the Assembly, when not a word could reach my ears through the din
of Babel that their colleagues made.&nbsp; But the oddest sight I
ever saw was the bow with which Colonel Jacquemet, conscious even
at the glorious moment that history would not <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>forget his
name, assured me that &ldquo;the devoted army of a Gallant and a
Glorious Prince would follow him to the death, when Honour led
and Duty called.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment P&egrave;re Pellico slipped round to my side
and said, &ldquo;A word with your Highness.&nbsp; A most
unfortunate report has got abroad that your Highness is a
heretic.&nbsp; What is to be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I very much fear I am,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely your Highness has never formally joined a
Protestant body?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Protestant?&nbsp; Oh, no.&nbsp; I am a freethinker; a
follower of Strauss rather than of Dr. Cumming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How your Highness has relieved my mind!&nbsp; Only a
freethinker&mdash;but that is nothing.&nbsp; I feared that
possibly your Highness might have suffered a perversion to some
of the many schisms.&rdquo;&nbsp; He bowed and hurried off into
the town, while <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>taking the arm of Baron Imberty I said, &ldquo;Introduce
me to M. Blanc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness wishes that M. Blanc should be presented
to your Highness, but there are three hundred and ten or three
hundred and twenty gentlemen who take precedence of M.
Blanc.&nbsp; Nevertheless, your Highness has only to
command.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, touch my arm as we pass him in the crowd,
and I will speak to him informally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My ideas of etiquette would have horrified Madame von
Biegeleben, the lady-in-waiting to my poor mother; still, I was
improving already, as may be seen.</p>
<p>As we left the station building a little man in black, who
when he is twenty years older will be as like M. Thiers in person
as he already is in tact, in power of talk, and in the
combination of a total absence of fixed opinions with a <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>decided
manner, made a low bow, accompanied with the shrewdest smile that
I had seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; I said, halting before him, &ldquo;is M.
Blanc.&nbsp; I am glad to have so early an opportunity of
commencing an acquaintance, which I hope to improve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Serene Highness does me too much
honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus I passed the man who played Haussmann to my Emperor, but
who had the additional advantage which the costly baron of
demolishing memory certainly did not possess, of being a
magnificent source of revenue to my state.</p>
<p>Mounting the really fine horse that they had sent me down, and
escorted by the sixteen mounted carbineers (who do police duty on
foot in ordinary times at Monte Carlo and in the town), I rode
off at a sharp trot by the winding road.</p>
<p><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>&ldquo;Will your Serene Highness graciously please to go
at a walk, for otherwise the guards will not have time to get up
by the military road and to form again to receive your Highness
at the <i>Place</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did as I was bid, of course.&nbsp; Bouquets of violets were
showered on me as we passed through the narrow street, and the
scene on the public square in front of the castle was really
fine.&nbsp; The sun was setting in glory over the Mediterranean
in the west; on the north the Alpes Mon&eacute;gasques were
beginning to take the deep red glow which nightly in that
glorious climate they assume.&nbsp; On the east the palms at
Monte Carlo stood out sharply against the deep still blue sky,
and in the far distance the great waves of the ground swell were
rolling in upon the coast towards Mentone and the Italian
frontier, with thousands of bright white sea-gulls speckling the
watery <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>hills with dots of light.&nbsp; At the palace gate I was
received by the old dowager princess.&nbsp; She bent and kissed
my hand.&nbsp; I threw my arms round her neck and kissed her on
both cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was kindly meant, Highness,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;but your Serene Highness is now the reigning prince, and
in the presence of the mob your dignity must be kept
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passing the two great Suisses who, arrayed in gala costume,
stood magnificently at the gate&mdash;but whose wages I
afterwards discovered were supplemented by showing my bedroom
when I was out to English tourists at a franc a head&mdash;we
entered the grand courtyard, ascended the great stairs, and
passed straight into the reception hall known as the Salle
Grimaldi.&nbsp; There, standing on a dais, opposite to the
magnificent fireplace and chimney-piece, with the baron at my
side, I held a levee, and received the vicar-general, p&egrave;re
de Don; the <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>cur&eacute; of the cathedral, l&rsquo;abb&eacute; Ramin;
the chevalier de Castellat, vice-president of the council of
state; the chevalier Voliver, member of council of state, and
president of the council of public education; the Marquis de
Bausset-Roquefort, president of the high court of justice and
member of the council of state; the treasurer-general, M.
Lombard; Monsignore Theuret, the first almoner of the household;
Monsignore Ciccodicola, the honorary almoner; Colonel the Vicomte
de Grandsaigne, my first aide-de-camp; Major Pouget
d&rsquo;Aigrevaux, commandant of the palace; the two
attach&eacute;s of M. de Payan in his office of
secretary-general, MM. Stephen Gastaldi and John Blanchi; my
doctor, M. Coulon, a leading member of the council of education,
and evidently a most intelligent man; the cur&eacute;s of the six
smaller churches; the five professors of the Jesuit college of La
Visitation; three aides-de-camp; the chef du cabinet; the <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>chamberlain
himself, who had introduced the others; and four officers of
guards and one of carbineers, in addition to Colonel Jacquemet,
whom I have already named.&nbsp; No conversation took place, and
the presentations being over in five minutes, I got out in the
garden before dark for a quiet stroll by myself before
dinner.</p>
<p>I was struck by the scene.&nbsp; The tall palms, the giant
tree geraniums blooming in masses down the great cliffs to the
very edge of the dark blue sea, the feathery mimosas, the
graceful pepper trees laden with crimson berries, the orange
grove, the bananas fruiting and flowering at the same time, the
passion flowers climbing against the rugged old castle walls, all
were new to me&mdash;unused to the south, and brought up in
Buckinghamshire, in Cambridgeshire, and in central Germany.&nbsp;
The scene saddened me, I know not why, and I asked myself
whether, with the odd <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>combination of my opinions and my
position, I could be of any use in the world except to bring
Monarchy into contempt.&nbsp; Here was I, a freethinker, called
upon to rule a people of bigoted Catholics through a Jesuit
father&mdash;for I had already seen that P&egrave;re Pellico was
the real vice-king.&nbsp; Here was I, an ardent partisan of the
doctrine of individuality, placed suddenly at the head of the
most centralized administration in the world.&nbsp; What was to
be done?&nbsp; Reform it?&nbsp; Yes, but no reformer has so ill a
time of it as a reforming prince.&nbsp; Sadly I went in to a sad
dinner <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with my
crape-covered great aunt in a gloomy room, and so to bed,
convinced that unhappiness may co-exist with the possession of a
hall porter as big as Mrs. Bischoffsheim&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The next morning when I dreamily called for my coffee there
was brought to me along with it a gigantic envelope sealed with
soft wax <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>stamped with my arms, and containing a terrific despatch
of twenty-three pages.&nbsp; &ldquo;Rapport
Hebdomadaire.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Weekly report&rdquo; of what, I
asked myself.&nbsp; Why, I have but five thousand
subjects&mdash;the same number that Octavia Hill rules in
Marylebone with such success.&nbsp; I began to read.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On Monday night a man named Marsan called
the carbineer Fissori a fool.&nbsp; He was not arrested (see
Order No. 1142 and correspondence 70, 10, 102), but a private
report was addressed to the Council of State, on which the
Secretary General decided to recommend that Marsan should be
watched for a week; referred to the Sub-Committee on Public
Order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;M. Blanc on Tuesday visited the tunnel in the commune
of Turbie (France) by which he hopes to obtain an additional
water supply for the Casino.&nbsp; As M. Blanc had not had the
courtesy to inform the secretarial office of his <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>excursion it
was impossible to send an agent to obtain details of what took
place.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So on for twenty and more pages, the last informing me of the
names of the fishing boats that had come in and gone out, of the
time of sunrise, and of the fact that a private in my guards had
caught a cold in his head.</p>
<p>It was unbearable.&nbsp; These formalities should be
suppressed at once.&nbsp; The administration should be
decentralised.&nbsp; I rang and sent to the secretarial office
for M. de Payan.&nbsp; I addressed him thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gather from this tedious document that my
principality of five thousand persons possesses every appliance
and every excrescence of civilized government except a
parliament.&nbsp; The perfection of bureaucracy and of red tape
has been reached in a territory one mile broad and five miles
long.&nbsp; No doubt centralisation is less hurtful than it is
elsewhere in a country so small that it is <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>virtually all
centre, but I intend that this state of things (for which you are
in no way responsible) shall cease.&nbsp; In the first place
kindly inform me of the facts.&nbsp; What are the expenses and
what are the revenues of the state, and what is the number of its
officials?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are, Sir,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;including
your household and the officers of your guards, one hundred and
twenty-six functionaries in Monaco.&nbsp; There are sixty
soldiers and carbineers, and there are one hundred and fifty
unpaid consular and diplomatic representatives of Monaco
abroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many servants have I in all, including stable
men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you mean to say that there are three hundred and
sixty-one persons employed under the crown for a population of
thirteen hundred male inhabitants of full age?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>&ldquo;Yes, Sir, and M. Blanc employs on his works and
at the Casino eight hundred of the remainder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a startling state of things, but I soon found out
that, as Colonel Jacquemet had used his men twice over on my
arrival, so we used our politicians twice or thrice, politicians
being happily scarce with us.&nbsp; Many posts were filled by one
man, a plan which has its advantages as well as its drawbacks,
the advantages predominating in a country where there are eleven
hundred and sixty posts to fill and only thirteen hundred grown
male inhabitants.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of the way in which we used our men, Baron
Imberty, our Governor-General for instance, was also President of
the Council of State, Chancellor of the Order of St. Charles,
President of the Maritime Council, President of the Board of
Public Works, President of the Bureau de Bienfaisance, etc.
etc.</p>
<p><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>Thanks
to M. Blanc and his gambling establishment, and thanks to the
large private fortune of my family, the finances of Monaco were
in a flourishing position.&nbsp; Prince Charles had had half a
million of francs a year of private fortune and of revenue from
the gambling tables.&nbsp; My cousin Albert had had three hundred
thousand francs a year.&nbsp; I consequently had eight hundred
thousand francs of private fortune, or &pound;32,000 a year, out
of which I could easily keep up the palace, the stables, and, if
I chose, a powerful steam yacht, together with my cousin&rsquo;s
house in Belgium as a summer residence.&nbsp; The cost of the
government for army, church, education, and justice, was two
hundred thousand francs a year.&nbsp; Public works were dealt
with liberally by M. Blanc as a part of his
&ldquo;concession.&rdquo;&nbsp; The ordinary revenue was derived
from four sources, each contributing about an equal share.&nbsp;
These were:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>I.&nbsp; The payment of the
Government of France for half the value of the tobacco sold in
the principality on behalf of the French <i>r&eacute;gie</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent">II. The payment of France for customs
collected by France in my ports.</p>
<p class="gutindent">III. The payment by the &ldquo;Paris, Lyons,
M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e&rdquo; Railway for right of
passage.</p>
<p class="gutindent">IV. Our only local tax, one on all lands and
houses changing hands.</p>
<p>The total receipts were two hundred thousand francs, or about
the same as the total expense of government.</p>
<p>I dismissed M. de Payan; and without telling anyone where I
was going I walked up to the Casino by myself.</p>
<p>I was little known by sight at present in the town, as those
who had seen me enter it in uniform and on horseback the day
before would hardly recognize me in deep mourning <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>and on
foot.&nbsp; I passed unnoticed by the guards, and on reaching the
Casino, hot and dusty, was stopped by one of the employ&eacute;s
of the bank, I said, &ldquo;Take me to M. Blanc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under similar circumstances the Prince of Wales is introduced
as &ldquo;Captain White,&rdquo; but then he is not a
<i>sovereign</i> prince; and I preferred to give no name at all
than to assume an alias.</p>
<p>I found him literally &ldquo;a counting out his
money.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is to say, two clerks were counting
rouleaus of gold while he at a small table was quietly playing
patience with two packs of cards.&nbsp; At a bureau was a third
clerk, an Englishman, translating into French for his benefit one
of Mr. Bagehot&rsquo;s leaders in the <i>Economist</i>.</p>
<p>He knew me at once, although he had seen me but for a moment
and in a wholly different dress.&nbsp; Bowing low, and speaking
not to me but <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>to his clerks, he said, &ldquo;Qu&rsquo;on nous
laisse.&rdquo;&nbsp; The moment they had left the room he bowed
to the ground again, and said, &ldquo;Ah monseigneur, votre
seigneurerie me fait trop d&rsquo;honneur!&nbsp; J&rsquo;allais
&eacute;crire &agrave; monsieur le chambellan pour lui demander
de vouloir bien solliciter une audience en mon nom, afin de
d&eacute;poser mes respectueux hommages aux pieds de votre
Altesse.&nbsp; Elle me comble en venant chez moi
incognito.&rdquo;</p>
<p>M. Blanc, whose appearance I described before, is well known
to gambling Europe as a distinguished political economist, the
keeper of the greatest &ldquo;hell&rdquo; on earth, and the
loving father of a pair of pretty and accomplished daughters,
living upon roulette, but himself innocent nowadays of all games
but the mildest patience&mdash;of which he knows sixty
kinds.&nbsp; At Monaco he is more than a public character: he is
a benefactor and a prince.&nbsp; Attacks may be made upon <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>gambling
establishments even conducted as his is, but I am disposed to
agree with the Jesuit fathers of the Visitation that the Monaco
roulette&mdash;forbidden to the inhabitants of Monaco and of the
neighbouring parts of France&mdash;does not do much harm to
anyone, although I could hardly go with P&egrave;re Pellico so
far as to prohibit the building of a Protestant church while he
tolerates a &ldquo;hell,&rdquo; and even permits his students to
visit the musical portion of its rooms.&nbsp; I had no wish in my
proposed reforms to reform out of existence my roulette
revenue.&nbsp; I wished indeed to make good use of it; better use
than my predecessors had done.&nbsp; I wanted to make of Monaco a
Munich and a Dresden all in one.&nbsp; I would have a gallery of
the greatest modern pictures&mdash;great ancient ones are not now
to be obtained&mdash;a magnificent orchestra, a theatre of the
first rank; art, in short, of all kind of the highest <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>class by
which to raise the culture of my people, who, excluded from the
gambling side of the Casino by a wise ordinance of my
predecessor, would reap the benefit without drinking the poison
of the roulette.</p>
<p>I found M. Blanc&rsquo;s mind running upon the question of
whether English families would be most attracted to Monaco by
pigeon-shooting or by an English church.&nbsp; The church he
fancied most, but owing to the opposition of P&egrave;re Pellico
it would have to be built upon the hill a mile off from the
Casino, in the territory of France.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will authorise you to disregard P&egrave;re
Pellico&rsquo;s bigotry, and to build it where you please,&rdquo;
I cried.</p>
<p>M. Blanc smiled, and said, &ldquo;If your Serene Highness will
excuse me, I had sooner not go against the Jesuits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t king in my own country, as it <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>appeared.&nbsp; Expel the Jesuits, the tempter within me
suggested; but then I wasn&rsquo;t Bismarck, and I hadn&rsquo;t a
&ldquo;national liberal&rdquo; party at my back.</p>
<p>I rapidly exposed my views to M. Blanc.&nbsp; I was much
struck by the fact that his practical mind insisted on viewing my
reforms as questions not of principles but of men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no men to back you,&rdquo; he kept saying;
&ldquo;and if you turn out your present set and get some clever
Germans you will be deposed.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had dropped the
excessive formality of speech with which he had begun.&nbsp;
Several times he used the phrase, &ldquo;Dr. Coulon is the only
man you have.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, after thinking for a time,
&ldquo;What do you propose to gain by your reforms?&nbsp; You are
rich.&nbsp; Your people are contented.&nbsp; Why trouble
yourself?&nbsp; As for works of art, as for theatre, as for
orchestra, these things are matters of money, and I will do my
best to <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>help.&nbsp; I am not sure that as a mere investment they
will not pay, and at all events I will do my best to make them do
so; but as for your reforms of army, church, and education that
you talk about, I beg your Highness to leave it all alone.&nbsp;
The shares in the bank will fall ten per cent. when it is
known.&nbsp; My shares here are like the funds at Paris, they
hate liberty.&nbsp; The less liberty, the higher they
stand.&nbsp; It is just the same at Paris.&nbsp; Suppress a
journal, and the <i>rente</i> rise a franc.&nbsp; Suppress all
the journals, and they would rise five francs!&nbsp; Suppress the
Assembly, and they would rise ten!&nbsp; Does your Serene
Highness take part in pigeon-shooting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Making nothing of M. Blanc, except as to art matters, I
returned slowly to the Castle, where I found the Council of State
assembled to take the oaths.</p>
<p>I chatted with the members of the Council, <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>but arranged
to develope my plans in the first place to a few
carefully-selected individuals.&nbsp; I fixed hours at which I
would receive M. de Payan; Dr. Coulon; the cur&eacute; of the
cathedral; l&rsquo;abb&eacute; Ramin; P&egrave;re Pellico; and
Colonel Jacquemet; after seeing the Governor General, Baron
Imberty, and talking matters over with him.&nbsp; Baron Imberty I
only saw because not to see him would be to pass a slight upon
him; but I had no hope of help from him, and none from Colonel
Jacquemet.&nbsp; From P&egrave;re Pellico I knew that I should
meet with opposition, and I received him only to see how strong
and of what nature the opposition would be.&nbsp; I built my
hopes upon M. de Payan, Dr. Coulon, and l&rsquo;abb&eacute;
Ramin.</p>
<p>To Baron Imberty I said only that I contemplated a reform in
the army, a gradual liberation of the church from state control,
and the <a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>re-organization of the schools.&nbsp; He answered that
my wish was law, but that the church was very well as she
stood.</p>
<p>To Colonel Jacquemet I explained in detail my military
re-organization scheme, which was the best of my reforms.&nbsp; I
pointed out to him that his force of forty men, now reduced to
thirty-eight by the unfortunate wart and cold, was only preserved
from becoming the laughing-stock of Europe by its exceptional
discipline and courage.&nbsp; It was absolutely necessary for me
to say this or he would have had a fit upon the spot.&nbsp; I
directed that a list should be prepared of all the male
inhabitants aged from sixteen to thirty, and numbering, as I
calculated, about eight hundred.&nbsp; That of them those
physically fit&mdash;some six hundred, as I should
suppose&mdash;were to receive drill, and ultimately
uniforms.&nbsp; The gallant forty men were to become sergeants,
<a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>corporals,
and inferior officers of the new national regiment.&nbsp; Captain
Ruggeri and Lieutenant Gasignol were named its majors, and
Lieutenants Plati and De la Rosi&egrave;re the senior
captains.&nbsp; Four other captains were to be selected from
among the privates and non-commissioned officers of the
guard.&nbsp; The new levy was to be unpaid, and the only
increased expense would be the uniforms and rifles, and at first
the additional pay of the ten new officers.&nbsp; As vacancies
occurred in company officers they were to be filled up by
election by the company, but the majors were to be appointed by
the colonel.&nbsp; The cost of the uniforms and arms I proposed
to meet by selling for old iron our twenty magnificent, but
useless pieces of old artillery.&nbsp; Modern artillery for the
fortress I proposed to provide out of my private income, and as
defence of the town was our only possible service, of field
artillery I <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>decided to have none.&nbsp; The night sentry duty at the
palace was to be performed by the paid sergeants only, and the
regiment was to parade but once a week.&nbsp; I could see that
Colonel Jacquemet did not like it, but he bowed and left the
room.</p>
<p>My next interview was with M. de Payan.&nbsp; He heartily
concurred in my army reform, and said that no measure could be
better for the country, educationally, than my plan of universal
service of this limited character.&nbsp; When I came to talk of
church reforms, however, M. de Payan was very cold and hard to
fire.&nbsp; He advised me to talk the matter over with the
cur&eacute;, l&rsquo;abb&eacute; Ramin, a most moderate man, and
to beware of Father Pellico.&nbsp; From this negative position I
could not move him.</p>
<p>The cur&eacute; was my next visitor.&nbsp; He also agreed
heartily in the wisdom of my army <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>reform.&nbsp; He listened without
dissent to my proposal for the gradual cessation of the small
grant to the priests, including that to himself.&nbsp; On the
other hand, when I spoke about the necessity of procuring lay
teachers for the schools, he began to weep.&nbsp; I changed the
subject, and when I allowed him to leave the room he said, with a
singularly sweet smile, that he would go with my reforms as far
as he could, that so just a man as my Highness would not harm his
country, that God would watch over his church. I was touched by
Abb&eacute; Ramin.</p>
<p>Dr. Coulon was then shown in.&nbsp; A man of intellect, as I
could see at the first glance.&nbsp; I set before him my army
reform, and he was delighted with it.&nbsp; I touched upon the
separation of church and state, and he said that it was not hard
to be done at Monaco&mdash;in name, <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>that is, but difficult indeed to be
done in fact.&nbsp; Still he supposed the name of separation was
what I wanted, and the gradual cessation of the stipends, which
would put Monaco in accord with the modern movement.&nbsp; I then
referred to education.</p>
<p>He shook his head, and answered, &ldquo;I should be your
Highness&rsquo;s sole supporter, and I am a materialist, and only
tolerated here on account of my medical skill, and placed on the
Council of Education because, as I am not in the habit of running
my head against stone walls, I always side with the
Jesuits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I insisted on the vast improvement in the standard of secular
education to be expected from the introduction of highly trained
lay teachers, and said that the priests should be absolutely free
to teach the children out of school hours.</p>
<p><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>His
reply was a singular one, and shook me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness is a democrat,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How then can your Highness impose your will in this matter
upon a people who are unanimous?&nbsp; If your Highness wishes to
escape individual responsibility for the existence of the present
state of things, your Highness can dissolve the council of state
and institute an elective parliament.&nbsp; That parliament would
consist, let us say, of twelve members.&nbsp; If so, eleven would
be priests or Jesuits, and the twelfth M. Blanc of the
Casino&mdash;a body which would resemble in complexion some of
the school boards in your Highness&rsquo;s favourite
England.&nbsp; Your Highness has a heavy task, and if that task
be persevered in, I fear that the state of your Highness&rsquo;s
nerves will be such as to require my prescriptions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was very free in his conversation, the old doctor, but it
was a pleasing change after Baron <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>Imberty and M. de Payan; not but what
Abb&eacute; Ramin had much attracted me.</p>
<p>I did my best to charm P&egrave;re Pellico.&nbsp; I courted
him as my other subjects courted me.&nbsp; He was expansive in
manner; but I am not a fool, and though only twenty-four, I knew
enough of human nature to see that there was another P&egrave;re
Pellico underneath the smiling case-work which talked to
me.&nbsp; To my military reform he had no objection, provided I
exempted Jesuit students from service.&nbsp; I answered that I
would exempt all those at present in Monaco, to which he replied
that he feared then that I should never have the pleasure of
seeing any others.&nbsp; I thought to myself &ldquo;here
is&rdquo;&mdash;but P&egrave;re Pellico smiled and slowly spoke
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness was thinking, I venture to imagine, that
that would be an additional reason <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>for hurrying your military
reform.&nbsp; But I must crave the pardon of your Highness for
speaking except in reply to your Highness.&nbsp; I have not the
habit of courts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I spoke then of the Church; he was indifferent&mdash;the
salaries of his four professors could easily be got from
Italy.&nbsp; I then touched upon education.</p>
<p>P&egrave;re Pellico, to my astonishment, exclaimed, &ldquo;But
on the contrary; my opinions are not different from those of your
Highness.&nbsp; They are the same.&nbsp; But as a democrat I do
not venture, although I may be wrong, to force them upon the
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here was a change of base.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were your Highness,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I
would dismiss the Council of State and call an elected parliament
to frame a constitution.&nbsp; That would be a more regular
method of proceeding <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>than limiting your own prerogative by
the exercise of that very prerogative itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;is not the country
somewhat small for the complicated machinery of
parliament?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why then not try a Plebiscite, &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or
&lsquo;no,&rsquo; upon certain written propositions, as in
Zurich?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How liberal a politician can afford to be when he has
the people with him,&rdquo; I thought to myself as I bowed out
Father Pellico.</p>
<p>For the next three weeks, until the end of February, things
went smoothly with me.&nbsp; My great aunt bothered me so to
marry a &ldquo;nice steady young lady who would maintain the
dignity of the Court, check the extravagance of the steward, and
count the linen,&rdquo; that I got Dr. Coulon to tell her that
she would die unless she removed to Nice.&nbsp; She preferred a
short remove to a long one, and took herself off to <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>my great
relief.&nbsp; She was a very fussy, but a clever and a really
good old lady.&nbsp; My army reform went well enough, and the
church edict was fulminated without meeting with
opposition.&nbsp; I bought, through Mr. Gambart, who often came
to Nice, a charming Leighton and a glorious Watts, and a fine
Verboeckhoven from M. Blanc, as a beginning of the public
collection.&nbsp; I moved the councils to the palace, and fitted
up the public offices thus rendered vacant as my museum.&nbsp; I
got M. Lucas at the Casino to improve his already admirable
orchestra, to start a free school for instrumental music, and to
play once a week in the town of Monaco instead of at Monte
Carlo.&nbsp; I wrote to M. Gounod, whom I had the honour to count
among my friends, to offer him the Louis Quinze rooms beyond the
Chambre d&rsquo;York, at the north-west corner of the Castle,
with the most lovely view in both directions, <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>and the
prettiest decorations to my mind in all the palace, if he would
come and stay with me as a permanent visitor, and countenance our
musical efforts.&nbsp; I founded a school for modelling in clay,
a class in decorative art which I taught myself, and I made the
arrangements for the reception of a troop of actors in the
winter, and for the production of Gounod&rsquo;s &ldquo;Jeanne
d&rsquo;Arc&rdquo;&mdash;a piece which was suggested by
P&egrave;re Pellico.&nbsp; In the palace itself I made many
improvements.&nbsp; Of the Chambre d&rsquo;York I left nothing
but the pretty mosaic floor, but the room itself, which had been
gilt from top to bottom, bed and all, by my great-grandfather to
take out the taste of the Great French Revolution, during which
the palace had been a poor-house, I turned into a meeting room
for the Council of State.&nbsp; My steam yacht had come with a
temporary crew of English tars, and my two <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>great 15-inch
60-ton Krupp guns&mdash;one for the terrace, seawards, and one
for the garden, landwards&mdash;were ordered.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;reports&rdquo; had been abolished; the nagging
surveillance of the police had been abolished; the Church
establishment had been abolished; and I then had nothing left to
abolish but myself, the abolition of myself being a measure from
which I shrank although, like King Leopold, I was ready to go if
my subjects wished it.</p>
<p>The only one of my reforms which was really popular was the
national army, which afforded all the young married men in the
principality a weekly holiday away from their wives.&nbsp; But
Major Gasignol, who had a &ldquo;soul above buttons,&rdquo; used
on parade when he was acting as adjutant to take an opportunity
of reminding me of the days of glory when one of my ancestors,
Grimaldi II., about the time of the Norman <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>conquest of
England, had delivered at Rome the Pope from the forces of no
less a personage than the Emperor.</p>
<p>All this time, however, my education scheme and my
substitution of an elective for a nominated council were in
abeyance, the first on account of P&egrave;re Pellico&rsquo;s
opposition, the second I might almost say on account of his
support.</p>
<p>Dr. Coulon, consulted by me, often used to say, &ldquo;Why
does not your Highness throw the responsibility upon a parliament
of leaving matters where they are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I wish to change them,&rdquo; I as often
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can understand that your Highness should wish to be
thought to wish to change them, but further than that point I can
not follow your Highness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I seriously thought of clapping Dr. Coulon <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>into prison
for his impertinence, but then he was the only liberal in Monaco,
and I was a liberal prince.&nbsp; How I wished, though, that my
uncle had not been such a fool as to invite the Jesuits, harassed
in Italy in 1862, to take refuge in his dominions.</p>
<p>I was no further advanced than my grandfather, Florestan I.,
who when overtaken by the events of 1848, which lost him Mentone
and Roquebrune, contemplated a parliament, which however he never
formed.&nbsp; It was a funny constitution was that one which he
posted on the walls, and over which I had often mused.&nbsp; It
had not gone further than being posted on the walls, I should
add, because my grandfather found that it would not bring back
Mentone, and as he was strong enough to keep Monaco with or
without it he had, very sensibly, put it in the fire.&nbsp; The
11th article of it was the <a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>oddest:&mdash;&ldquo;La presse sera
libre, mais sujette &agrave; des lois
r&eacute;pressives.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the first article gave the
tone to the whole:&mdash;&ldquo;The sole religion of the State is
the Catholic, Apostolic, Roman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I strolled up the terraces of Monte Carlo, which always
reminded me of John Martin&rsquo;s idea of heaven, and consulted
M. Blanc.&nbsp; He was in especially good humour that day,
because &ldquo;Madame Brisebanque&rdquo; and &ldquo;the
Maltese&rdquo; had both been losing money.&nbsp; Still, when I
talked of my parliament and my education reform, he talked of
&ldquo;Jacob&rsquo;s ladder&rdquo; and of other infallible
systems of ruining him which never had any result except that of
beggaring their authors.&nbsp; He told me a long-winded story of
how at Homburg a company called &ldquo;La Contrebanque&rdquo; had
won twenty-four days in succession, and how on the twenty-fifth
they had sent for a watchman and an iron chest to guard their
winnings, how that afternoon <a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>their secretary had lost the whole
capital in eighteen <i>coups</i>, and how the innocent watchman
had marched up and down all night religiously guarding an empty
chest.&nbsp; I tried to hark back to my subject, when off he went
again at a tangent, and told me how the day before on opening the
&ldquo;bienfaisance&rdquo; collection-box in the hall of the
hotel they had found no money, but all the letters of an American
gentleman who had posted them there the year before.&nbsp;
Another of his anecdotes was of a lady who, having lost, had
eaten a thousand-franc note on a slice of bread and butter to
improve her luck.&nbsp; M. Blanc left the Casino in his carriage
just after I had ridden off, and without seeming to look I saw
well enough out of the corner of my eyes after he had passed me
on the road, that the people uncovered to him more universally
and for a longer time than to myself.&nbsp; There was, <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>however, one
difference between us&mdash;I returned the bows and he did
not.</p>
<p>I gave up M. Blanc and pursued my reforming course,
abandoning, however, the idea of a parliament and fearing to
touch education.&nbsp; My government, now in working order,
resembled in no way that which you English think the best of all
possible polities&mdash;&ldquo;constitutional
monarchy&rdquo;&mdash;which with you appears to me to mean a
democratic republic tempered by snobbism and corruption.&nbsp;
Mine was a socialistic autocracy, which, in spite of my failure,
I maintain to be the best of governments, provided only that you
can secure the best of autocrats.</p>
<p>I had no one to back me in what I did.&nbsp; Major Gasignol
and some of the other officers were strongly favourable to the
army reform, which gave them service and promotion.&nbsp; Dr.
Coulon was half favourable to my views, and a <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>quarter
favourable to my ways of working them out in action.&nbsp;
L&rsquo;Abb&eacute; Ramin was conciliatory and kind.&nbsp; M. de
Payan was grimly neutral.&nbsp; Every other functionary was an
active, though veiled, enemy to nine-tenths of my
proposals.&nbsp; The people were abjectly passive, and I almost
wished that the auberge of the &ldquo;<i>Crapaud
Volant</i>&rdquo; of <i>Rabagas</i> had had a real
existence.&nbsp; At last, however, I conjured up the spirit to
found a school with lay teachers, arranging to pay its cost over
and above the expected fees out of my own purse.&nbsp; No one
came to it, and the Jesuit schools and the schools of the
<i>fr&egrave;res de la doctrine</i> continued to be
thronged.&nbsp; The Catholic schools were supported by the
state.&nbsp; Mine were supported by myself.&nbsp; I went a step
further, and I offered Father Pellico the alternatives of
stopping the state contributions to all schools, or of continuing
them, provided that lay <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>teachers only were employed during
the principal hours of the day.&nbsp; He coldly said that an
agreement of the nature proposed by me would be contrary to his
duty, and that if I chose to stop the state contributions to his
schools the effect of my action would be to shake my throne
without harming them.&nbsp; He added that if he was to go to
prison he was at the service of my officer of the guard.&nbsp; I
replied that he was welcome to his opinion.</p>
<p>The next day the edict appeared.&nbsp; It was countersigned by
Baron Imberty, who disapproved of it, but not by M. de Payan, who
had resigned and left for Nice to consult the Bishop.&nbsp; As I
drove through the town in the afternoon, I was coldly received by
the people, and the proclamation was torn down on the following
night.&nbsp; The weekly parade of the militia was put off for
fear of a hostile demonstration; and on the <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>day on which
it would have taken place I received, instead of the muster-roll
of the national regiment, a vote of thanks from the Executive
Committee of the English National Education League, and notice of
my unanimous election to membership of the Council of that
body.</p>
<p>A strange event occurred in the afternoon, (it was the 11th of
March), to distract my thoughts.&nbsp; General Garibaldi, who had
been travelling <i>incognito</i>, and with the permission of the
French Government, given conditionally on the <i>incognito</i>
being strictly preserved, to visit his birthplace&mdash;Nice,
applied to me to know whether I would receive him if he stopped
at Monaco for a day on his return.&nbsp; I replied that I should
be glad to see him, the more so as I had met his son Ricciotti at
Greenwich in June 1870, at the dinner of the Cobden Club, to
which orgy he and I had both been lured <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>by the
solicitations of the arch-gastronomist, the jovial Mr. T. B.
Potter.&nbsp; I did not add that our acquaintance had been
interrupted by the war in which the same clever and conceited
officer had cut up my cousin&rsquo;s (the King of Wurtemberg)
troops at Ch&acirc;tillon-sur-Seine.</p>
<p>On the 12th the old General came, and I met him at the station
and drove him to the palace.&nbsp; The news that he was with me
soon spread through the town, and a mob collected at the palace
gates.&nbsp; The General, to whom I had given the
&ldquo;bishop&rsquo;s rooms,&rdquo; which had once been occupied
by Monseigneur Dupanloup, his arch enemy, imagined that the crowd
was composed of his admirers, and, leaning upon his stick, he
proceeded to harangue them from the window of the private
apartments.&nbsp; Some hundreds of my subjects, I was afterwards
informed, had listened to him languidly enough until he <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>began to
attack the Jesuits, when arose the uproar which brought me to his
room, and all my household into the courtyard.&nbsp; I begged him
to remember where he was, but the howling of the mob had excited
the old lion, and the more they threatened the more violently he
declaimed.&nbsp; When he was pulled into a chair by Major
Gasignol the mischief was done, and a maddened crowd was raging
on the <i>place</i> crying &ldquo;&agrave; bas Garibaldi,&rdquo;
&ldquo;&agrave; bas les Communistes,&rdquo; &ldquo;&agrave; bas
le Prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Jacquemet made his way to me and said, &ldquo;Sir, I
can count on twenty of the sergeants and corporals who are in the
courtyard, ex-soldiers of your Highness&rsquo;s ex-garde.&nbsp;
They are grand old soldiers, and with the strong walls to help
them will hold this <i>canaille</i> in check.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He might have said, &ldquo;Sir, I don&rsquo;t like your <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>ways, and
have disapproved of everything that you have done, but after all
you are the rightful Prince of Monaco, as well as a good fellow,
saving your Highness&rsquo;s presence, and I am ready to die for
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; He only spoke the words
that I have set down.</p>
<p>My answer was an unhesitating one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, Prince Florestan the Reformer, am not going to hold
my throne by force if I can&rsquo;t hold it by love; and,
moreover, if I wished to do so it is doubtful whether I could
succeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I spoke the crowd parted asunder, and I saw advancing
through it in a wedge the English blue-jackets from my yacht,
armed with cutlasses.&nbsp; A few stones were thrown at them, but
of these they took not the smallest notice.&nbsp; At their head
was the captain of the port, a native Monegascan, the very man
who years before had saved my sailor cousin from the <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>waves.&nbsp;
They entered the courtyard, and I at once asked them to make
their way, with General Garibaldi in the midst, back to the
yacht, and steam with him to Mentone, land him, and return.&nbsp;
At the same time I sent for Father Pellico.&nbsp; It was lucky
the sailors had come, for I soon discovered that the carbineers
had made common cause with the mob, and that the sergeants who
were ready to die for me would not have escorted Garibaldi.</p>
<p>The mob howled dismally as he left, but he was embarked safely
just before Father Pellico reached the palace gate.&nbsp; I told
him that the General had left, and asked him whether this
concession would satisfy the crowd.&nbsp; He asked whether I was
prepared at the same time to give way about the schools.&nbsp; I
told him that if I thought that after doing so I could continue
to reign with advantage to the country and credit <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>to myself I
would willingly give way, but that if he thought that in the
event of my abdication the public peace could be maintained until
a vote was taken to decide the future of the country, I should
prefer to return to my books and to my boat.&nbsp; He said that
he hoped that I should stop, but that if, on the other hand, I
went he thought that order would be maintained.</p>
<p>I bowed to him and said, &ldquo;P&egrave;re Pellico, you may
if you please occupy the throne of the Grimaldis.&nbsp; I shall
leave in an hour when the yacht returns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went on to the balcony and attempted to address the
crowd.&nbsp; If they would have listened to a word I said I might
have turned them, but not a syllable could be heard.&nbsp; I
could not &ldquo;address my remarks to the reporters,&rdquo;
because owing to the wise precautions of my predecessor <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>with regard
to the press there were none.&nbsp; I retired amid a shower of
small stones.</p>
<p>Colonel Jacquemet&rsquo;s language was fearful to listen
to.&nbsp; The air was thick with his curses.&nbsp; I was reminded
of the question of a little girl friend of mine, who having been
taken out one day to an inspection by the Commander-in-Chief of
the garrison of Portsmouth upon Southsea common, asked on her
return home if &ldquo;the Duke of Cambridge wasn&rsquo;t a very
pious man,&rdquo; explaining that she had heard him &ldquo;say
his prayers&rdquo;&mdash;alluding doubtless to His Royal
Highness&rsquo;s favourite expression of &ldquo;God bless my body
and soul!&rdquo;&nbsp; If he had ever read history the colonel
would have known that the fire-eating d&rsquo;Artagnan of
&ldquo;Three Musketeers&rdquo; renown once commanded the fortress
of Monaco for Louis the Fourteenth, under my ancestor the
Marshal, and he might have been inspired by <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>a desire to
emulate his fame, but, as it was, he seemed chiefly moved by a
loathing for his tattered fellow-subjects.&nbsp; He wanted to mow
them with grape&mdash;of which we had none; he wanted to blow
them into the air&mdash;but to reason with him was useless, and I
was unable even to fix his attention enough to bid him
farewell.</p>
<p>As I left the palace, surrounded by the tars and preceded and
followed by the sergeants of the ex-garde, Abb&eacute; Ramin came
running up and seized me by the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Serene Highness must not leave us,&rdquo; he
cried; &ldquo;the people are irritated for a moment against their
prince, but happier days will come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can stop if I please, Abb&eacute; Ramin,&rdquo; I
replied, &ldquo;but only either by firing upon the people, or by
blockading them and depriving <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>the women and children of the upper
town of their daily bread.&nbsp; I will do neither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;History will speak of your Highness as your Highness
deserves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear friend&mdash;for I believe you are my only
friend in Monaco&mdash;I thank you for coming to bid me farewell,
but don&rsquo;t talk of history, for history will only declare me
to have been an obstinate young fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We moved off slowly down the hill amid the hisses of the
crowd.&nbsp; The sergeants formed square upon the quay, I
embraced Colonel Jacquemet and the Abb&eacute;, stepped into the
gig, and in a minute was on board.&nbsp; Steam was up, and the
next evening I landed at Marseilles.</p>
<p>By a telegram from the Abb&eacute; I learnt that an informal
vote of the adult male inhabitants of the principality had been
taken that day, and that the result was this:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>For Annexation to France</p>
<p style="text-align: center">1131&mdash;<i>Oui</i>.<br />
1&mdash;<i>Non</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Non</i> was M. Blanc, who, being a Frenchman, ought not
to have been allowed to vote at all.&nbsp; I heard afterwards
that on learning my departure he had pronounced the following
epitaph upon me:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah le jeune homme est parti.&nbsp; Je m&rsquo;y
attendais.&nbsp; Il aimait la libert&eacute; celui
l&agrave;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Casino is removed to Cairo, and M. Blanc&rsquo;s eldest
daughter is to marry the Viceroy&rsquo;s youngest son.</p>
<p>My tutor at Cambridge received me with a solemn face; but I
laughingly exclaimed, &ldquo;You see, Sir, after all I did want
an <i>exeat</i>, even if an <i>absit</i> would not have
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The only later news that I have to record is a letter from my
friend Gambetta, promising that when he becomes President of
France I <a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>shall be pr&eacute;f&ecirc;t of the Department of the
Alpes Maritimes, which includes my ex-dominions, on condition
that I am very moderate.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: center">END.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There is no moral that can be drawn from my fall applicable to
the present state of English politics.&nbsp; This may be seen
indeed from the comments of the only three English papers of last
Friday and Saturday that noticed it.&nbsp; The <i>Morning
Advertiser</i>, which, Tory as it is, prefers Radical-Orangeism
to Tory-Popery (and beer to both), classed me along with the
Tichborne claimant as a victim to the Jesuits, whereas I
wasn&rsquo;t a victim at all; and if I had been, should have been
a victim to my own obstinacy, as I certainly could have stopped
at Monaco if I had pleased to do so&mdash;either by raising a
popular clamour against the priests, which would <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>have been
immoral, or by accepting P&egrave;re Pellico&rsquo;s conditions,
which would have been humiliating.&nbsp; The <i>National
Reformer</i>, the organ of Mr. Bradlaugh, patted me on the back
as an ill-used republican; and the <i>Standard</i> said that my
fall showed the absolute necessity of maintaining the 25th clause
of the Education Act intact, which is what I could not for the
life of me see.&nbsp; On the contrary, so opposite are the
conditions of England and of Monaco, that what would have
succeeded in one would have failed in the other as a matter of
course.&nbsp; In England you have a divided church; an increasing
and active though still little numerous Catholic body; a
materialistic world of fashion which goes alternately to Mr.
Wilkinson and Canon Liddon, Mr. Haweis and Mr. Stopford Brooke,
and does not believe a word that any of them says&mdash;unless it
is Mr. Haweis, but then, doctrinally speaking, he says
nothing.&nbsp; <a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>You have the old nonconformist bodies, able and powerful
still, though less powerful than before 1868; and you have the
Wesleyans, pulpy but rich.&nbsp; Outside of them all you have
people who believe two-thirds of them in the Bible pure and
simple, but with prominence given in their minds to the
communistic side of the New Testament, and one-third in nothing
unless it is Mr. Charles Watts, Mr. Austin Holyoake, and Mr.
Bradlaugh.&nbsp; The most flourishing publications in your
country are <i>Zadkiel&rsquo;s Almanac</i> and <i>Reynolds&rsquo;
Newspaper</i>, belonging to the opposite poles, but equally at
war with all that is most powerful and rich and respectable in
your society.&nbsp; What resemblance is there in this state of
things, full of life but wholly wanting in unity, to that at
Monaco, dead, but single in faith?&nbsp; At Monaco all that
believed&mdash;and most believed&mdash;were earnest Catholics,
wielded <a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>for political purposes by one man.&nbsp; Had my
parliamentary scheme been carried out the cumulative vote would
have been inoperative, and Mr. Hare had he been there would have
hanged himself from the castle flag-staff, for there was no
minority.&nbsp; As in East Prussia the peasants, suddenly
presented with universal suffrage by Von Bismarck and asked for
whom they would vote, said with one accord, &ldquo;For the
King.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;You
can&rsquo;t&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Then for the Crown
Prince&rdquo;&mdash;so at Monaco the population would have
replied &ldquo;for P&egrave;re Pellico.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the same there is a moral to be drawn from my fall, and it
applies to the French Republic.&nbsp; I conjure my friends of the
French radical party not to let radicalism in France be bound up
with indecent speeches made over the graves at &ldquo;civil
funerals,&rdquo; or with the denial of the Immortality of the
Soul.&nbsp; In England, in <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>spite of occasional attempts of the
<i>Standard</i> to couple &ldquo;atheists&rdquo; and
&ldquo;republicans,&rdquo; no such warning is needed; but in
France it comes almost too late.&nbsp; No system of government
can be permanent which has for its opponents all the women in the
country, and for supporters only half the men; and any party will
have for opponents all the women which couples the religious
question with the political and the social, and raises the flag
of materialism.&nbsp; Women are not likely to abandon the idea of
a compensation in the next world for the usage which too many of
them meet with in this.</p>
<p>As for my failure at Monaco, I went too fast.&nbsp; I agree
with Mr. Freeman, your English historian, that a sudden breach in
the continuity of national institutions is an evil, and that
&ldquo;the witness of history teaches us that, in changing a long
established form of executive government, <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>the more
gently and warily the work is done the more likely it is to be
lasting.&rdquo;&nbsp; I could have stopped at Monaco by humbling
myself, but at all events I went too fast.&nbsp; If they take me
back, which I really think for their own sakes they had better
do, I will go much slower.&nbsp; But I have no time to write any
more, for I have been put without training into the first boat,
and we are to stop up during the greater portion of the Easter
&ldquo;vac.,&rdquo; as we have a capital chance of &ldquo;keeping
head.&rdquo;</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
